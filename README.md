# Challenge: "Post Feed with Voting"

Goal: Build a mini Reddit-like post feed where users can see a list of posts, upvote/downvote them, and filter by "Most Upvoted".

## Requirements

### Core Features (React + JS)
- Display a lst of posts (title + votes)
- Each post has upvote/downvote buttons
- Clicking upvote/downvote updates the vote count

### State Management (Redux)
- Use Redux to store the list of posts
- Create actions/reducers for voting
- [Optional] Use middleware like Redux Thunk for async behavior (e.g. mock API)

### Bonus (if time allows)
- Add a filter toggle to view posts sorted by votes
- Add a form to add a new post
